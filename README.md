# 🎸 Guitar Chord Identifier (by Red House Digital)

This is an interactive, web-based tool that helps guitar players identify chords based on finger placement. Built for beginners and intermediate players, this app visually mimics a guitar fretboard and displays the name of the chord you're playing — including barre chords using E-shape and A-shape patterns.
